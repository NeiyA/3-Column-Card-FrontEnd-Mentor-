Mobile First Site using vanilla CSS and HTML


## Welcome ! 

Thank you for checking out my first project as a front end developer.

This project was done through vanilla HTML and CSS, though there are still things to be added such as hover effects and transition. The layout
is complete along with the responsive design.
